dashify --- use dashes as word separators in file names

Traverse a directory structure converting

this_dir/this other dir/withAFile.txt

into

this-dir/this-other-dir/with-a-file.txt

Install with

$ python setup.py install

If you have setuptools it will install dashify as an executable; just
do

$ dashify --help

for options.

If you don't have setuptools will just install the module.  You can
always make dashify.py executable and copy it to your path.
